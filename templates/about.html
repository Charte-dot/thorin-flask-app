    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
    to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
            the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
            found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death

        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also
            nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
            feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the
            quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and
                Gandalf began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. He was wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, his
                tucked into the belt and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived and
                he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves.
                Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin
                and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves
                filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.

            <p>
                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori
                became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other
                Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the
                other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

                    and Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and
                    traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

                    Bofur and Bombur, where he played the clarinet. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by
                    Trolls and nearly killed by Goblins, Wargs, Stone giants, Great Spiders, and the dragon Smaug
                    himself. A valiant and brave warrior, Bifur never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies
                    with all his strength, killing numerous enemies. In the fallout of the great battle, Dáin II
                    Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure, and he retired to live at the Lonely Mountain

                    dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five
                    Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon.

                <p>
                    Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
                    Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
                    though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
                    of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left."
                    Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old
                    during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside
                    Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

                    Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception
                    of Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of
                    Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served
                    Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet his
                    ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience.
